<h2 class="green bold vspace">GETTING STARTED</h2>

City Golf League will provide you a home page, bracket you into the appropriate division and send you your schedule (schedules are available prior to the start of league play).

<p>You contact your opponent via the online message system, schedule your match, pay the appropriate green fees and post your results online.</p>

<!-- Added 3 classes to h2 tag -->
<h2 class="green bold vspace">FORMAT</h2>
<p>Format for the league is net match play. Match play is you vs. your opponent in head-to-head competition where each hole is contested. Net means a player will give or receive strokes based on handicaps.</p>
	
<p>The online scorecards indicate who receives strokes and on what holes strokes are taken.</p>
	
<p>League play scoring is similar to hockey where a match win is awarded two points (2), a tie is awarded (1) point and a loss zero (0).</p>
	
<p> Match standings are given as a certain number of holes up, a certain number of holes down, or all square (AS).  Play continues until one player is down by more holes than remain. If the match ends all square (AS), the match is declared a draw and each player will receive one (1) point.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the home course player to initiate contact with his/her opponent. If a player cannot play, the player who can play has the option of rescheduling or taking a default victory. Please make every effort to play each match - even if rescheduling is required.</p>
