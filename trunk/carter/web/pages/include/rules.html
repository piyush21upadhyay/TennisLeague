<h2 class="bold">GENERAL RULES</h2>
<ul>

        <a id="usgalink" href="http://www.usga.org/Rules.aspx?id=7788" target="_blank">USGA match play rules</a> govern play.
    </li>
    <li>The player with the lowest net score wins the hole.</li>
    <li>Match standings are given as a certain number of holes up, a certain number of holes down, or all square (AS).</li>
    <li>A winner is declared and the match is over when one player is down by more holes than remain. For example if player A is three holes up with two holes to play, Player A is declared the winner and the results would read: Player A 3 & 2.  If player A is one up going into the 18th hole, and Player A wins the hole, the results would be shown as Player A 2 up.  </li>
    <li>League play scoring is similar to hockey where a match win is awarded two points (2), a tie is awarded (1) point and a loss zero (0).</li>
    <li>The top sixteen players in each division advance to the playoffs. See <a href="#playoffs">PLAYOFFS</a> section for tiebreaker rules.</li>
    <li>If the match ends all square (AS), the match is declared a draw and each player will receive one (1) point. The exception to this rule is during the playoffs (see <a href="#playoffs">PLAYOFFS</a>).</li>
    <li>Players shall play and record all 18 holes regardless of match standings.</li>
    <li>In match play, players do not have the option to putt-out as they do in stroke play. The player farthest away always putts first.</li>
    <li>In match play, players have the option to concede putts. Since scores will be posted, please be conservative when conceding putts.</li>
    <li>Players should not concede putts for scores under par/net par since there is a weekly birdie contest (see <a href="#weely">WEEKLY WINNERS</a>).</li>
    <li>Players should review the USGA rules of golf for additional information on rules of match play. </li>
</ul>
