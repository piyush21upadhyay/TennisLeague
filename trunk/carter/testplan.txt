This file is an attempt to break down the City Golf League web application
into small chunks which can be tested thoroughly given an outline of what
needs to be tested in each section.

Main Entry Page
---------------
This is the page that users get to by default when they enter the site.  It
contains links for Signup, Login, Enter Site, View Demo.  It also is where
the user is redirected to if they are already in the site and they decide to
login or choose a different city.

Anonymous User Interaction
--------------------------
This is how the pages in the site react to a user that is not logged in.  This
takes two forms.  The first is if a user gets into the site without having
selected a city from the main entry screen.  The second is if they have chosen
a city and are just viewing the site for that city anonymously.

In the first case, there is not much a user can do.  Most of the pages you
get to just say something like "You must login or choose a city" with links
to allow you to do one of those actions.  A tester needs to make sure that
every page on the site gives a reasonable message when the user is in this state.

In the second case, the site is pretty usable but has limited functionality.
For example, you can view public messages but not create new ones.  You can
view a profile page that says "Welcome Guest" and gives you the option of 
signing up.  Most of the other pages have pretty full functionality.

Signup
------
This is the page that allows new users to sign up.  It should deliver
reasonable error messages for missing or invalid data.  It should take
the user to their profile page when they successfully sign up.

Navigation
----------
There are several ways to navigate and these should all be available from every
page on the site.  These are:
  - Top left allows navigation to About, Rules and Contact pages.

  - Top right has Login/Signup if not logged in and Logout if logged in
  - Main nav contains Home, Player Profile, Schedule, Members, Courts, 
  	  Leaderboard, Playoffs, and Champions
  - Bottom left contains Feedback, Terms of Use and Privacy Policy links
  
QUESTION: What happens if the user is logged in (so they are automatically in
          a city and they choose the "cities" link and go to another city.  We
          need to make sure there are no weird anomalies with that.
